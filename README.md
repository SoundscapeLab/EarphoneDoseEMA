This repository contains three R scripts used to estimate noise dose from earphone use based on real-ear measures and ecological momentary assessment. 
Earphone listening levels are extracted from Audioscan Verifit xml files using extractVerifitData.R.
Earphone levels with A-weightings and diffuse-field corrections are calculated by calcOverallEarphoneLevel.R.
Doses are calculated using the data created by the first two scripts combined with EMA responses on minutes of earphone use per week using calcEarphoneDose.R.
